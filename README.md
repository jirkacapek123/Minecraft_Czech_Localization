Forestry Localizations
======================

Localizations for Forestry

### en_US

The en_US localization is not part of this repository but instead part of the main code. Do not add a en_US.lang file.

### Encoding

Files must be encoded in ISO 8859-1. UTF-8 will not work. Pull requests, submissions or contributions not encoded in ISO 8859-1 will have to be rejected or reverted.

### Converting

If you want to convert your localization to ISO 8859-1, use that: https://codecside.com/3rdpage/us/javaUnicode/converter.html. Just paste translation to box above, click 'Characters to Hexadecimal Codes' and converted text will show up in box below!

### Testing your language files

Put the files into your .minecraft directory into a subfolder "lang/" that mirrors that of the Forestry jar. Any correctly named localization file should take precedence over the defaults in the jar.

Alternatively you can also add your localization files to the Forestry .jar directly. The "lang/"-folder in it is not signed, so modifying it is safe.
