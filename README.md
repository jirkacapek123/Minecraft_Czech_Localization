Minecraft Localizations
======================

Localizations for various Minecraft mods

### Encoding

Files must be encoded in ISO 8859-1. UTF-8 will not work. Pull requests, submissions or contributions not encoded in ISO 8859-1 will have to be rejected or reverted.

### Converting

If you want to convert your localization to ISO 8859-1, use that: https://codecside.com/3rdpage/us/javaUnicode/converter.html. Just paste translation to box above, click 'Characters to Hexadecimal Codes' and converted text will show up in box below!

### Testing your language files
You can put the language files into a resource pack and apply it in game. Any correctly named localization file should take precedence over the defaults in the jar.

Alternatively you can also add your localization files to the corresponding mod .jar directly. The "lang/"-folder is not signed, so modifying it is safe.
